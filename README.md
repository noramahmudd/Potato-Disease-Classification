# 🥔 Potato Disease Classification using Deep Learning  

## 📜 Project Description  
This project applies **Deep Learning** to classify potato leaf diseases using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
The model detects diseases such as **Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves** from images.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- Image Processing  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains images of potato leaves categorized as:  
✅ **Healthy**  
❌ **Early Blight**  
❌ **Late Blight**  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noramahmudd/Potato-Disease-Classification.git
   cd Potato-Disease-Classification
